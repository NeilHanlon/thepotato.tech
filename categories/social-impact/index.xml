ResolveX
builds software and data solutions for crisis call centers—988 suicide
prevention lines, domestic violence hotlines, and other critical mental health
resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mental health crisis response has significant gaps that technology can help address. ResolveX builds tools to make crisis counselors more effective and help researchers understand patterns that could prevent crises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They serve 988 operators—resource-constrained nonprofits handling life-or-death situations. The technical requirements are unique: rock-solid reliability, security for sensitive mental health data, and cost-effectiveness for organizations that measure impact in lives saved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

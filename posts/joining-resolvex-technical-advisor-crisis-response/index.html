builds software and data solutions for crisis call centers—988 suicide
prevention lines, domestic violence hotlines, and other critical mental health
resources.</p><h2 id=why-this-matters>Why This Matters</h2><p>Mental health crisis response has significant gaps that technology can help address. ResolveX builds tools to make crisis counselors more effective and help researchers understand patterns that could prevent crises.</p><p>They serve 988 operators—resource-constrained nonprofits handling life-or-death situations. The technical requirements are unique: rock-solid reliability, security for sensitive mental health data, and cost-effectiveness for organizations that measure impact in lives saved.</p><h2 id=the-technical-challenge>The Technical Challenge</h2><p>ResolveX is hitting the classic startup infrastructure inflection point—scaling from scrappy solutions to supporting a primary mental health data warehouse without over-engineering.</p><p>My role: provide neutral perspective on infrastructure, security, and scaling decisions. Lightweight advisory rather than hands-on implementation, helping spot issues early and suggest practical solutions within their budget and mission.</p><h2 id=what-im-doing>What I&rsquo;m Doing</h2><p>The immediate priorities are pretty straightforward:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Infrastructure & Security Audit</strong>: Review current hosting, architecture, and configurations. Light security testing and access review.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ongoing Advisory</strong>: Lightweight consultation (~5 hours/week) for feedback and neutral oversight on scaling decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content Collaboration</strong>: Educational content that benefits both crisis response and broader tech communities.</p></li></ul><h2 id=the-bigger-picture>The Bigger Picture</h2><p>This isn&rsquo;t just consulting work—I&rsquo;ve been getting into emergency response volunteering (CERT, amateur radio) and care deeply about how we handle mental health crises. ResolveX has potential to become an open-source-friendly, public-impact organization changing mental health data collection and analysis.</p><h2 id=technical-philosophy>Technical Philosophy</h2><p>The constraints make this engaging: high reliability and security requirements, minimal budget, maximum impact. Every architectural decision must justify real value to crisis counselors and those they help.</p><p>This requires &ldquo;appropriate technology&rdquo;—sophisticated enough for requirements but simple enough to maintain and afford. Systems engineering with purpose, not hope-based engineering.</p><h2 id=looking-forward>Looking Forward</h2><p>I&rsquo;ll write follow-ups about specific technical challenges as this develops. Infrastructure engineering for social impact deserves more attention.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re working on mission-driven technology or considering how your skills could have broader social impact, reach out. <strong>There&rsquo;s more of this work that needs doing.</strong></p><hr><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in similar advisory or consulting work, you can reach me
through <a href=https://shrugpw.com>my consulting practice</a> or find me on the usual places around the
internet.</p></div></div><div class=disqus></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=text-muted>&copy; All rights reserved. Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and

I'm excited to share that I've joined [ResolveX](https://resolvex.com) as a technical advisor. ResolveX
builds software and data solutions for crisis call centers—988 suicide
prevention lines, domestic violence hotlines, and other critical mental health
resources.

## Why This Matters

Mental health crisis response has significant gaps that technology can help address. ResolveX builds tools to make crisis counselors more effective and help researchers understand patterns that could prevent crises.

They serve 988 operators—resource-constrained nonprofits handling life-or-death situations. The technical requirements are unique: rock-solid reliability, security for sensitive mental health data, and cost-effectiveness for organizations that measure impact in lives saved.

## The Technical Challenge

ResolveX is hitting the classic startup infrastructure inflection point—scaling from scrappy solutions to supporting a primary mental health data warehouse without over-engineering.

My role: provide neutral perspective on infrastructure, security, and scaling decisions. Lightweight advisory rather than hands-on implementation, helping spot issues early and suggest practical solutions within their budget and mission.

## What I'm Doing

The immediate priorities are pretty straightforward:

- **Infrastructure & Security Audit**: Review current hosting, architecture, and configurations. Light security testing and access review.

- **Ongoing Advisory**: Lightweight consultation (~5 hours/week) for feedback and neutral oversight on scaling decisions.

- **Content Collaboration**: Educational content that benefits both crisis response and broader tech communities.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just consulting work—I've been getting into emergency response volunteering (CERT, amateur radio) and care deeply about how we handle mental health crises. ResolveX has potential to become an open-source-friendly, public-impact organization changing mental health data collection and analysis.

## Technical Philosophy

The constraints make this engaging: high reliability and security requirements, minimal budget, maximum impact. Every architectural decision must justify real value to crisis counselors and those they help.

This requires "appropriate technology"—sophisticated enough for requirements but simple enough to maintain and afford. Systems engineering with purpose, not hope-based engineering.

## Looking Forward

I'll write follow-ups about specific technical challenges as this develops. Infrastructure engineering for social impact deserves more attention.

If you're working on mission-driven technology or considering how your skills could have broader social impact, reach out. **There's more of this work that needs doing.**
